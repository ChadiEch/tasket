# Deploying Tasket Frontend to Railway

This guide explains how to deploy the Tasket frontend as a standalone service on Railway using the Node.js buildpack.

## Prerequisites

1. A Railway account (https://railway.app)
2. A deployed backend service (separate deployment)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Create a new Railway project**
   - Go to https://railway.app/new
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo" or "Deploy from template"

2. **Connect your repository**
   - Select the repository containing the Tasket frontend code
   - Make sure to select the correct branch

3. **Configure environment variables**
   - In your Railway project, go to Settings â†’ Variables
   - Add the following environment variables:
     ```
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-service.up.railway.app/api
     VITE_WS_BASE_URL=wss://your-backend-service.up.railway.app
     ```

4. **Configure the service**
   - Railway will automatically detect this as a Node.js project
   - The build process will:
     - Install dependencies using pnpm
     - Build the React application
     - Serve the static files using `vite preview`

5. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically deploy your frontend
   - The service will be available at the provided URL

## Important Notes

- The railway.toml file is configured to use Nixpacks builder with a custom start command
- Make sure your backend service is deployed and accessible before deploying the frontend
- Update the VITE_API_BASE_URL to point to your actual backend service URL
- The frontend uses WebSockets for real-time updates, so ensure WebSocket connections are allowed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that all environment variables are correctly set
2. Verify that your backend service is running and accessible
3. Check the Railway logs for any build or runtime errors
4. Ensure the PORT variable is being used correctly in the start command
